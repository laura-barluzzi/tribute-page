      <blockquote> Ah yes, the facts. I've spent my whole life running after them, convinced that if I found demonstrable, incontrovertible facts I would also find some kind of truth. Now aged sixty-three, faced with this war which has only just begun and with an unsettling premonition of what is soon to follow, I'm beginning to think the facts are just a front and that the truth they mask is at best like a Russian doll: as soon as you open it up you find a smaller one inside, then another which is even smaller, then another and another, till finally all you are left with is something the size of a grain.

  <h3 class="header-text">Biography</h3>
    <p class="main-text"> Tiziano Terzani was an Italian journalist and writer, best known for his extensive knowledge of 20th century East Asia and for being one of the very few western reporters to witness both the fall of Saigon to the hands of the Viet Cong and the fall of Phnom Penh at the hands of the Khmer Rouge in the mid-1970s. Terzani was born in Florence to poor working class parents. He attended the University of Pisa as a law student and studied at the prestigious <i>Collegio Medico-Giuridico</i> of the <i>Scuola Normale Superiore</i>. After graduating, he worked for <i>Olivetti</i>, an italian office equipment producer.
<br/>After a job experience in Japan, his passion for Asia started. Terzani knew much about the historical and political background of Asia, but had also a deep interest in the philosophical aspects of Asian culture. Though an unbeliever, he always looked in his journeys for the spiritual aspects of the countries he was visiting. He lived for years at a time in Beijing, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok and New Delhi. Terzani died on 28 July 2004, aged 66, due to stomach cancer.  Terzani's experiences in Asia and  his thoughts about life are described in articles and essays in newspapers, as well as in the several books that he wrote.
